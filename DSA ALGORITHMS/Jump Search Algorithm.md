# Jump Search

- Jump Search is a searching algorithm used for **sorted arrays**
- Instead of checking every element (like Linear Search), it jumps ahead by a fixed number of steps (usually √n).
- When it overshoots the target, it performs a **linear search backwards** in the block.
- It’s faster than Linear Search but slower than Binary Search.
